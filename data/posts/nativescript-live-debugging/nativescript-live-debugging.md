You may ask, “What is live debugging?” For a long time NativeScript developers had to make a hard choice while developing applications. We had to choose between debugging or using LiveSync. We couldn’t do both. With the latest release, we now don’t have to make the hard choice; we can get both debugging and LiveSync at the same time! I call this live debugging, and this video tutorial will show you how it’s done.

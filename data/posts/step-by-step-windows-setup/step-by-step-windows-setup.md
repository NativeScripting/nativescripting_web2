Let's set up a NativeScript development environment on a Windows machine, from scratch!

<br/><br/>

When starting out with NativeScript development, I find that many folks initially struggle with the setup and installation of all the required software. This has been a real pain point and a blocker for a lot of folks trying to use the framework.

<br/><br/>

It's one of the biggest reasons why the NativeScript team created the NativeScript Playground and the <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-preview" target="_blank">awesome new **preview** command</a>. Both of these methods allow you to live sync a development workflow to an app running on your physical iOS or Android device! These tools are truly amazing to work with.

<br/><br/>

However, sometimes you need to develop mobile apps on your local machine and use the iOS simulator, or the Android emulator on your computer, instead of inside the Preview app on a physical device. I'm in this camp of people, and I think many developers are too. That's why it's important to make the setup process easier - and the NativeScript team delivered here as well. They've scripted out the prerequisite installation steps quite nicely. All you have to do is run the scripts for each step.

<br/><br/>

In this video tutorial, I show you how to go through the process of setting everything up on a new Windows laptop that has absolutely nothing on it except the factory installed software. I follow the <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/ns-setup-win" target="_blank">NativeScript Advanced Setup for Windows Guide</a> found in the NativeScript docs. Check it out!

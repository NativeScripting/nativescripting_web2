NativeScript 2.5 just dropped and it has really awesome features like Chrome debugging and an improved run command. So I couldn’t wait to upgrade my existing installation. I’ve already [written a post](https://nativescripting.com/posts/upgrading-the-nativescript-cli-and-projects) on upgrading [and a video about the same](https://youtu.be/lH04B5o9Am4), but I wanted to record an real world upgrade process and see if I hit any snags while doing it. So I recorded it and uploaded the video. [Here is a great introduction to all the new features in NativeScript 2.5](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-25-is-now-available).

There are two parts to an upgraded

1. Upgrading the NativeScript CLI
2. Upgrading your application project(s)

The video listed above will show you how to upgrade and the issues I faced while doing it. 

Thanks for watching!

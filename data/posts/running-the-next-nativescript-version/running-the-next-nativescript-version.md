NativeScript is an open source project that keeps evolving with releases happening every couple of months. Perhaps you want to try out what's coming up in the next release, or perhaps you saw some way you can contribute to the project. Either way, I'm going to show you how you can grab the latest and greatest bits from the nativescript-cli repo on GitHub and be able to run multiple versions of the CLI on your machine.

You can read the full article on the [NativeScript.org blog](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/how-to-build-and-run-the-latest-nativescript-cli-version-from-github) and you can watch the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/uSUUfI4kD_o) that takes you through the steps.

#### Update August 15, 2016

We got some great news today from [Vladimir Enchev](https://twitter.com/vladimir_enchev/status/765172029121302528). Now you can install the latest NativeScript build from the master branch by appending the `@next` when you’re installing NativeScript. This will overwrite your existing installation. If you still want to be able to have the latest release version installed globally, but have the master branch to play with on the side, then you can still follow the tutorial in this blog post.

> Now you can get the latest NativeScript CLI build from our master branch:
“ npm install nativescript@next -g ”

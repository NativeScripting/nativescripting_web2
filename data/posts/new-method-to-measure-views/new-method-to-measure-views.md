This is another video tutorial in the series that looks into amazing new features in NativeScript version 4.1. This time I'm digging into the new `layoutChanged` event and trying it out in Core and Angular.

### Tired of having to use `setTimeout` to get native UI element measurements?

Me too! It just seemed hacky and dirty. But no more! As of version 4.1 of NativeScript, you can now use the new shiny event called `layoutChanged`. This works for Angular projects and of course Core projects too.

I'll show you what the problem was and how it was solved in this new video tutorial.

If you like this style of video tutorials, you might like our courses. The latest [Hands-on UI course](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-hands-on-ui) is a pretty popular starting point for those starting out learning NativeScript and how to work with UI.

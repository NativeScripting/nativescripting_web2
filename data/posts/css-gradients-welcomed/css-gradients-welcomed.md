This video tutorial walks you through using a brand new feature in NativeScript version 4.1 - css gradients!

### CSS gradients have been on the NativeScript styling wish list for quite some time, and they have finally arrived!

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to use the new gradients feature and how this will work with a few basic UI Widgets and ActionBar.
I've twisted and turned gradients to see where the limits are and I found a couple. More on that in the video.

If you like this style of video tutorials, you might like our courses. The latest [Hands-on UI course](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-hands-on-ui) is a pretty popular starting point for those starting out learning NativeScript and how to work with UI.

I hope you enjoy this peek at gradients, and let me know (<a href="https://twitter.com/digitalix" target="_blank">@digitalix</a> on Twitter) what you think of the new gradients feature and what else you'd like to see posted here.

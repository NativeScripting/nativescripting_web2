I'm excited to announce my latest project over at [NativeScripting](https://NativeScripting.com) â€“ NativeScript Vue and Vuex! This course provides an _overvue_ of Vuex and looks at how we can apply it to our NativeScript Vue projects.

<br/>

## What's Inside

Throughout the course, we'll look at everything from what state means, to appropriately mutating state with `actions`, `mutations`, as well as using `getters` to slice state when we need it most. We'll also be using the `module` approach to separate our state into different containers.

<br/>

Finally, we'll be spending time to ensure that our workflows are scalable by using the `map` helpers. This stops us having to manually access `state`, `actions`, `mutations` and `getters` with the `$store` prototype, and makes extending our Store a breeze!

<br/>

This course follows on from Alex's [Introduction to NativeScript Vue course over at NativeScripting](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-vue-introduction). As we're primarily focused on state management here, if you're new to Vue and the surrounding ecosystem, I'd recommend you take that one first.

<br/>

At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of what state management in Vue is all about along with using all the convenience features of a state management library like Vuex.

<br><br>

[NativeScript Vue and Vuex](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-vue-and-vuex/) is another awesome course from NativeScripting and is now available at launch pricing.

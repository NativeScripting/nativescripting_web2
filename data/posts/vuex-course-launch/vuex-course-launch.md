I'm excited to announce my latest project over at [NativeScripting](https://NativeScripting.com) – NativeScript Vue and Vuex! This course provides an _overvue_ of Vuex and looks at how we can apply it to our NativeScript Vue projects.

<br/>

## What's Inside

Throughout the course, we'll look at everything from what state means, to appropriately mutating state with `actions`, `mutations`, as well as using `getters` to slice state when we need it most. We'll also be using the `module` approach to separate our state into different containers.

<br/>

Finally, we'll be spending time to ensure that our workflows are scalable by using the `map` helpers. This stops us having to manually access `state`, `actions`, `mutations` and `getters` with the `$store` prototype, and makes extending our Store a breeze!

<br/>

This course follows on from Alex's [Introduction to NativeScript Vue course over at NativeScripting](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-vue-introduction). As we're primarily focused on state management here, if you're new to Vue and the surrounding ecosystem, I'd recommend you take that one first.

## Here is what's in the course

Even though this video course is for beginners it doesn’t skip any foundational knowledge about how components derive from the main Vue instance and how Global components lead to Single File Components. There is also an extensive chapter on styling and animation as well as super useful info on tooling.

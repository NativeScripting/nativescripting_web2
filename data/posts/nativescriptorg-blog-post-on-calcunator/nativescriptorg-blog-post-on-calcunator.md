I wanted to build a little calculator app in NativeScript and make it resemble the iOS calculator. Not that we need another calculator out in the world, but I thought it would be a great way to show off some of NativeScript's less known abilities (at the time of this writing). Check out the [full article on nativescript.org](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/calcunator-the-nativescript-calculator) and grab the [source code for the app on GitHub](https://github.com/alexziskind1/nativescript-calculator-demoapp).

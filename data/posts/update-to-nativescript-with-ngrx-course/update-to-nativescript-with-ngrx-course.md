Do you manage your application state using the Flux pattern (now better knows as Redux, I suppose)? Well you should check it out since it will make your application state handling life much easier.
@ngrx is a Redux inspired set of libraries for Angular. You'll find exactly the same concepts used in @ngrx as you did in Redux: actions, reducers, and a single store. The difference here is that @ngrx is build on top of RxJS, so at the heart of the @ngrx store are observables. The @ngrx with NativeScript course on NativeScripting.com was just updated to the latest versions of everything! It's a gentle introduction to using @ngrx in a NativeScript with Angular application.

<br/>
Description: In this course, we build a simplified cryptocurrency price viewer powered by @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects. This allows us to use the power of RxJS based state management in our NativeScript applications and allows us to better reason about our projects.

What's great about this course is that it focuses on the core concepts of @ngrx store/effects and doesn't convolute the process with an overly complex application example.

Working on a team that has given me the experience to create production NativeScript and Angular applications, I’ve been in the trenches and have seen real world scenarios that someone might come across while building an app.
<br><br>

Hi, I’m Sean Perkins. This is my first post on NativeScripting, and I’m super stoked to share with you what I’ve learned with my new course; also my first one for NativeScripting.
<br><br>

I’m so happy to have finally brought you this course that reveals some of the tips and tricks that I’ve used to make my  NativeScript applications look better, all while improving productivity and the app’s performance.
<br><br>

Here are the major topics that we'll cover:
<br><br>

<h3>Styling Concepts and Tactics</h3>
<h3>Advanced Styling Topics</h3>
<h3>Building Real-World UI</h3>
<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<br><br>

You can find the course [here on NativeScripting](https://nativescripting.com/course/styling-nativescript-with-angular-applications). I would love to hear from you whether you have comments or questions, so don’t be afraid to reach out. Usually I’m hanging out on the NativeScript Community Slack channel along with most of the other NativeScript Progress Developer Experts. 
<br><br>

Check out my new course!

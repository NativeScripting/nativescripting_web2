## Course Description

Learn how an app, built using NativeScript that is already in the Apple and Google App stores, can be enhanced by applying newly learned animation techniques using both code animation and CSS animation. In this course, NativeScript: Animation Techniques, you’ll dive deeper into ways you can leverage the power of your environment to get beautiful animations with documented methods. First, you’ll learn how to write plain JavaScript property animation code without frameworks. Next, you’ll learn creating animation from sprite images using pure JavaScript. Then, you’ll learn leveraging code-based animation classes and function that get shipped with NativeScript and Angular 2. Finally, you’ll dive deep into the basics of CSS animation and applying them to your sample application and tapping into the raw power of Native platforms. By the end of this course, you’ll know more about NativeScript with Angular and how to build beautiful animations for your mobile applications.

## Audience

This course is for web developers who are already proficient with TypeScript and CSS, and are familiar with NativeScript. They want to expand their NativeScript knowledge to focus in on animation.

## What you’re doing

In this course, in addition to the documented instructions you'll find on the NativeScript and Angular websites, we're going to dive deeper into ways you can leverage the power of your environment to get beautiful animations with documented methods, as well as some less known techniques.

## Some of the major topics that we will cover include:

* Writing plain JavaScript property animation code without frameworks
* Creating animation from sprite images using pure javaScript
* Leveraging code based animation classes and functions that get shipped with NativeScript and Angular 2
* Deep diving into the basics of CSS animation and applying them to our sample application
* And finally tapping into the raw power of the native platforms to perform incredible animation gymnastics

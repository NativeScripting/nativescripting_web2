After over a year of planning and waiting for a super stable version, it’s my pleasure to announce that together with the stable version 2 release of NativeScript-Vue, we've released a beginner level video course called [NativeScript-Vue Introduction](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-vue-introduction/).
<br><br>

<br><br>

Whether you’re like me, a NativeScript developer who’s always wanted to try Vue, or you’re a Vue developer who wants to create native iOS and Android apps using your favorite UI framework, this course will get you started.

<br><br>

The course currently consists of seven chapters and 48 video lessons of content to get you started with NativeScript-Vue. It starts from scratch and builds your knowledge of working with UI in NativeScript while integrating Vue concepts. It describes the performance benefits of using certain native UI elements and navigation techniques over others. And it discusses how using Vue in a native mobile application is very similar to using it on the web, along with some differences.

<br><br>

## Make Your Own Chapter

This time I'm trying something new. I've added another chapter at the end of the course that's dedicated to showing NativeScript-Vue tutorials that students request. Many students end up having the same questions, so this section will explore those questions in video format. All I need from you is to send me your NativeScript-Vue related requests - things you want to see in video format. If I see enough interest in this, I'll continue this with other courses! Send me your requests via email or Twitter: [@digitalix](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=digitalix) or comment below.

## Here is what's in the course

Even though this video course is for beginners it doesn’t skip any foundational knowledge about how components derive from the main Vue instance and how Global components lead to Single File Components. There is also an extensive chapter on styling and animation as well as super useful info on tooling.

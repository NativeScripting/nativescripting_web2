Using Facebook login is pretty common in mobile apps today. There are many other third party authentication providers, but Facebook is extremely prevalent. With the nativescript-oauth plugin recently being updated, and the fact that I havenâ€™t created a blog post or video tutorial on using it with Facebook, I decided to go ahead and record a new video tutorial on how to get things set up.

This video tutorial shows you how to create a new NativeScript project and add the NativeScript Oauth plugin to it. It also shows how to register a new App on the Facebook Developer site and what features need to be enabled. Finally, it shows how to hook everything up together through a login process to get a access token.

You've built a mobile app. But is it secure?
<br><br>

There are many resources out there for learning how to do great things with NativeScript, whether it's UI, or animations, or performance. These are all important things to know.

<br>

There is one are that's often left out in the cold when it comes time to build and release an mobile app - and that's **Security**.

<br>

## Problem? What problem?

I recently ran a simple Twitter poll that showed me not most folks **don't know** or don't care whether their apps are secure or not. I chuckle to myself when I think about asking each of these folks whether they think security is *important* and I can pretty much say with certainty that their answer would be "Yes".

<br><br>

So how do we fill the huge gap in knowledge between developers that admit to not knowing how to secure their apps and knowing that they need to secure their apps?

<br><br>

Well, I thought a video course is a good place to start, so I'm totally thrilled to announce that after a year in the making, I've just published [Securing NativeScript Applications](https://nativescripting.com/course/securing-nativescript-applications).

<br><br>

## What's in the course?

This course is a practical guide on how to accomplish certain security related tasks in the NativeScript framework. Here are some topics that are covered.

This course is meant to show you some available options when it comes to securing your Nativescript apps, but itâ€™s by far not an exhaustive set of guidelines.
Using this course, you can cherry pick which security-related tasks you will implement for your own projects in your organizations, and always consult with a security expert to ensure your app scenario is well covered.
<br><br>

## Do I need your help?

I've been making video courses on NativeScripting for just over a year and I've created a few free courses and a few paid ones. There are a ton of folks taking the free courses all over the world. I'm just starting my Twitter following, and I don't really use Facebook so I can only share this important message with a limited number of people by myself.

<br>

It would be really awesome and would help me a lot if you share this announcement on social media, especially since being secure is a really good for your friends too!

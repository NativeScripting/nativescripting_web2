During development, I prefer using a local backend that I quickly spin up along with my NativeScript apps. Why? It's easy, it's offline, it gives me more control, and it allows me to reason about my app in a more realistic way during development.

<br/><br/>

In this video I use a collection of free and open source tools to get you up and running quickly and easily. We use Node and Express to run a local server, test out the API endpoints with Postman, and then convert the Hello World NativeScript with Angular app to fetch its data from this server. We even simulate a network delay and see how it effects loading and displaying of data.

<br/><br/>

I use a similar technique in the [NativeScript with Angular Pro course](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-with-angular-pro/) and the [NativeScript Core Pro course](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-core-pro/) right here on NativeScripting.

This video comes in at fifteen minutes - a bit longer than usual. But it's definitely worth watching.

For more video tutorials about NativeScript, look at our courses on [NativeScripting.com](https://nativescripting.com). The new [Hands-on UI course](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-hands-on-ui) is a pretty popular starting point for those starting out learning NativeScript and how to work with UI.

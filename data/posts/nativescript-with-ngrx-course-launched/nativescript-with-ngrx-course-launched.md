If you have used the Redux pattern for your application store before, you know how powerful the concept is. @ngrx is a Redux inspired set of libraries for Angular. You’ll find exactly the same concepts used in @ngrx as you did in Redux: actions, reducers, and a single store. The difference here is that @ngrx is build on top of RxJS, so at the heart of the @ngrx store are observables. The new course on NativeScripting.com was just launched and it’s a gentle introduction to using @ngrx in a NativeScript with Angular application.

Course Title: [NativeScript with @ngrx](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-with-@ngrx)
  
Description: In this course, we build a simplified cryptocurrency price viewer powered by @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects. This allows us to use the power of RxJS based state management in our NativeScript applications and allows us to better reason about our projects.
  
Author: Paul Halliday is a NativeScript Trainer on NativeScripting.com. He is a tech entrepreneur that specialises in cross platform mobile development. He has received numerous awards including the SIEM Prize and the Sunderland University Professional Award.
  
What’s great about this course is that it focuses on the core concepts of @ngrx store/effects and doesn’t convolute the process with an overly complex application example.
  
The course just launched so there is an attractive launch sale price. Check it out [here](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-with-@ngrx).
